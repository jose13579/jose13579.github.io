abstract: Hundreds of text detection methods have been proposed, motivated by their
  widespread use in several applications. Despite the huge progress in the area, which
  includes even the use of sophisticated learning schemes, ad-hoc post-processing
  procedures are often employed to improve the text detection rate, by removing both
  false positives and negatives. Another issue refers to the lack of the use of the
  complementary views provided by different text detection methods. This paper aims
  to fill these gaps. We propose the use of a soft computing framework, based on genetic
  programming (GP), to guide the definition of suitable post-processing procedures
  through the combination of basic operators, which may be applied to improve detection
  results provided by multiple methods at the same time. Performed experiments in
  the widely used ICDAR 2011, ICDAR 2013, and ICDAR 2015 datasets demonstrate that
  our GP-based approach leads to F1 effectiveness gains up to 5.1 percentage points,
  when compared to several baselines.

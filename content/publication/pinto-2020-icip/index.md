abstract: Stereo vision is a growing topic in computer vision due to the innumerable
  opportunities and applications this technology offers for the development of modern
  solutions, such as virtual and augmented reality applications. To enhance the user's
  experience in three-dimensional virtual environments, the motion parallax estimation
  is a promising technique to achieve this objective. In this paper, we propose an
  algorithm for generating parallax motion effects from a single image, taking advantage
  of state-of-the-art instance segmentation and depth estimation approaches. This
  work also presents a comparison against such algorithms to investigate the trade-off
  between efficiency and quality of the parallax motion effects, taking into consideration
  a multi-task learning network capable of estimating instance segmentation and depth
  estimation at once. Experimental results and visual quality assessment indicate
  that the PyD-Net network (depth estimation) combined with Mask R-CNN or FBNet networks
  (instance segmentation) can produce parallax motion effects with good visual quality.

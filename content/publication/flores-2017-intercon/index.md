abstract: The present work proposes to recognize the static hand gestures taken under
  invariations features as scale, rotation, translation, illumination, noise and background.
  We use the alphabet of sign language of Peru (LSP). For this purpose, digital image
  processing techniques are used to eliminate or reduce noise, to improve the contrast
  under a variant illumination, to separate the hand from the background of the image
  and finally detect and cut the region containing the hand gesture. We use of convolutional
  neural networks (CNN) to classify the 24 hand gestures. Two CNN architectures were
  developed with different amounts of layers and parameters per layer. The tests showed
  that the first CNN has an accuracy of 95.37% and the second CNN has an accuracy
  of 96.20% in terms of recognition of the 24 static hand gestures using the database
  developed. We compared the two architectures developed in accuracy level for each
  type of invariance presented in this paper. We compared the two architectures developed
  and usual techniques of machine learning in results of accuracy.

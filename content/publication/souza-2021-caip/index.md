abstract: 'Generating novel views from a single input is a challenging task that requires
  the prediction of occluded and non-visible content. Nevertheless, it is an interesting
  and active area of research due to its several applications such as entertainment.
  In this work, we propose an end-to-end architecture for monocular view synthesis
  based on the layered scene inference (LSI) method. The LSI uses layered depth images
  that can represent complex scenes with a reduced number of layers. To improve the
  LSI predictions, we develop two new strategies: (i) a pyramidal architecture that
  learns LDI predictions for different resolutions of the input and (ii) an image
  outpainting for filling the missing information at the LDI borders. We evaluate
  our method on the KITTI dataset, and show that the proposed versions outperform
  the baseline.'

abstract: In the last few years, several works have tackled the problem of novel view
  synthesis from a pair of stereo images or even from a single picture. However, previous
  methods are computationally expensive, specially for high-resolution images. In
  this paper, we address the problem of generating an efficient multiplane image (MPI)
  from a single high-resolution picture. We present the adaptive-MPI representation,
  which allows rendering novel views with low computational requirements. To this
  end, we propose an adaptive slicing algorithm that produces an MPI with a variable
  number of image planes. We also present a new lightweight CNN for depth estimation,
  which is learned by knowledge distillation from a larger network. Occluded regions
  in the adaptive-MPI are inpainted also by a lightweight CNN. We show that our method
  is capable of producing high-quality predictions with one order of magnitude less
  parameters, when compared to previous approaches. In addition, we show the robustness
  of our method for novel view synthesis on challenging pictures from the Internet.

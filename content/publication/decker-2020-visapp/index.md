abstract: Multiple research initiatives have been reported to yield highly effective
  results for the text detection problem. However, most of those solutions are very
  costly, which hamper their use in several applications that rely on the use of devices
  with restrictive processing power, like smartwatches and mobile phones. In this
  paper, we address this issue by investigating the use of efficient object detection
  networks for this problem. We propose the combination of two light architectures,
  MobileNetV2 and Single Shot Detector (SSD), for the text detection problem. Experimental
  results in the ICDAR'11 and ICDAR'13 datasets demonstrate that our solution yields
  the best trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency and also achieved the state-of-the-art
  results in the ICDAR'11 dataset with an f-measure of 96.09%.

        Responsibilities include:
        * Designed and implemented solutions to significantly reduce the time required to declare damaged packages, achieving a 10x improvement compared to the manual process. The new application uses machine learning for text detection to determine if a package is damaged, cloud storage via Amazon S3 to store damaged package photos, and programming languages like Python and JavaScript for development.
        * Developed a chatbot to assist users with common inquiries, such as tracking missing packages and monitoring packages in progress. The chatbot improved response times by 5x compared to manual handling, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

        Responsibilities included:
        * Proposed of an image inpainting model leveraging both CNNs and transformers to address challenges posed by large missing regions, this proposal achieved competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
        * Developed of a novel variable hyperparameter strategy applied to the transformer to reduce the computational complexity. We achieved superior results in efficiency in comparison with recent methods, 3x times more efficient.
        * Proposed of a image inpainting model by incorporating auxiliary information from the pencil sketch domain, aiming to deal with structural and textural inconsistencies. We achieved best results in some datasets like celebA and Paris StreetView datasets, and competitive resuls in Places 365 dataset.

        Responsibilities include:
        * Developed new algorithms based on scene representation (LDI and MPI) for the generation of parallax effect motion using a single image, achieving to propose a new light scene representation for restricted scenarios (e.g. cell phones). We published an paper related to our proposal using LDI and MPI, achieving competitive results with recent methods based on MPI and parallax effect motion.
        * Implemented and evaluated new algorithms based on GANs and visual transformers for image inpainting, achieving competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

        Responsibilities include:
        * Developed and implemented solutions to track damaged packages in Python, managing to increase the coverage of the number of detected damaged packages
        * Developed and implemented the new damage package declaration service using Javascript and React to reduce the number of damaged packages wrongly.
        * Developed a new functionality using Javascript and React, which adds the creation date of the resolution of the  undelivered package, helping to avoid losing the undelivered package within the range of the final delivery date.
         * Development of a new application that is responsible for managing the life cycle of a package from the barcode, developed in NodeJs, Typescript and React.

        Responsibilities included:
        * Proposed of an image inpainting model leveraging both CNNs and transformers to address challenges posed by large missing regions.
        * Developed of a novel variable hyperparameter strategy applied to the transformer to reduce the computational complexity.
        * Proposed of a image inpainting model by incorporating auxiliary information from the pencil sketch domain, aiming to deal with structural and textural inconsistencies.

        Responsibilities include:
        * Developed new algorithms based on scene representation (LDI and MPI) for the generation of parallax effect motion using a single image, achieving to propose a new light scene representation for restricted scenarios (e.g. cell phones).
        * Implemented and evaluated new algorithms based on GANs and visual transformers for image inpainting, achieving competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

Stereo vision is a growing topic in computer vision due to the innumerable opportunities and applications this technology offers for the development of modern solutions,  such as virtual and augmentedreality applications. To enhance the userâ€™s experience in three-dimensional virtual environments, the motion parallax estimation isa promising technique to achieve this objective. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for generating parallax motion effects from a single image, taking advantage of state-of-the-art instance segmentation and depth estimation approaches.  This work also presents acomparison against such algorithms to investigate the trade-off between efficiency and quality of the parallax motion effects, taking into consideration a multitask learning network capable of estimating instance segmentation and depth estimation at once. Experimental results and visual quality assessment indicate that the PyD-Netnetwork (depth estimation) combined with Mask R-CNN or FBNet networks (instance segmentation) can produce parallax motion effects with good visual quality

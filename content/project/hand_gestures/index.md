The present work proposes recognizing static hand gestures taken under invariations features like scale, rotation, translation, illumination, noise, and background. We use the alphabet of the sign language of Peru (LSP). For that, digital image processing techniques are used to eliminate or reduce noise, improve the contrast under a variant illumination, separate the hand from the background of the image, and finally detect and cut the region containing the hand gesture. We develop two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the 24 hand gestures. These two CNNs were developed with different amounts of layers and parameters per layer. The tests showed that the first and second CNN presents an accuracy of 95.37\% and 96.20\% respectively, using the database of 24 static hand gestures developed.
